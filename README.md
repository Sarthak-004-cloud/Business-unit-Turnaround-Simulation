# Strategic Turnaround Simulation for a Failing Business Unit

##  What This Project Is About
Imagine you're the strategy lead for a business unit that’s bleeding money — your job is to fix it. This project simulates that scenario using customer segmentation, churn analysis, and profitability levers.

##  What I Did
- Clustered customers based on behavior to identify low-profit, high-churn segments.
- Built a profitability model to simulate how pricing, cost control, and retention could impact revenue.
- Created a 6-slide executive summary deck with business actions and expected outcomes.

##  Skills & Tools Used
Python · pandas · Clustering (KMeans) · EDA · Business Simulation · Strategic Thinking
